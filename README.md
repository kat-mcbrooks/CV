Studying mathematics and spanish at University inspired my passion for solving problems collaboratively and systematically. Later, when working as an events manager, my creativity and can-do approach enabled me to efficiently resolve issues and respond effectively when faced with challenging circumstances. Through Makers, I have learnt to use these skills when working in a team to deliver a new app that meets user requirements, and in pair programming sessions to complete weekly challenges. 

I am excited by the stimulating, challenging environment and endless learning opportunities environment that a career in tech will offer./I am excited to find a role in the tech industry where I can make a positive impact and continue challenging myself to learn and improve my skills.
