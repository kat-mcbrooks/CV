## Kat Brooks

Highly motivated, detail-oriented and creative full-stack junior developer. From my years working in fast-paced teams within the Education and Charity sectors, I bring a wealth of transferable skills. These include project management, expert written and verbal communication skills and the ability to respond to changing priorities and requirements. 

Studying mathematics and spanish at University inspired my passion for solving problems collaboratively and systematically. Later, when working as an events manager, my creativity and can-do approach enabled me to efficiently resolve issues and respond effectively when faced with challenging circumstances. Through Makers, I have learnt to use these skills when working independently or within a team to deliver a new app or program that meets user requirements. Teammates value my expert debugging skills, positive attitude and commitment to reusable, test-driven code.

I am excited by the stimulating, challenging environment and endless learning opportunities that a career in tech will offer. Equipped with best practices and principles I gained through Makers, I look forward to applying my knowledge and continuing to expand my skillset within an inclusive and inspiring team.

- **Quick learner and adaptable team player**: I pivoted from events (donor relations) to trust fundraising, learning an entirely new skillset and processes, to meet the team’s changing priorities (caused by the impact of COVID-19) 
- **Communication and relationship management**: I built and strengthened relationships with colleagues across the organisation to collate information and meet tight deadlines set by our department head (for example donor reports, event briefings)
- **Adaptability and delivering results**: As our stakeholders were the charity's highest-value donors, I managed constantly changing project requirements and deliverables
